JENKINS
====================

In General--> Jenkins called as CI/CD tool but,

Jenkins is only used for CI --> take code --> build --> test

Explain what is CI
Continuous Integration = Continuous build + Continuous Test

Developers continuously generate/write code (old + new)--> so we need to continuously build and test

Maven does the same but it is manual, to automate use Jenkins

Before CI, everything is manual process
After CI, everything is automated


What is CD ? Continuous Delivery / Deployment

Continuous Delivery = Deployment Manually to Prod Env
Continuous Deployment = Deployment Automatically to Prod Env

Explain about Environments
PRE-PROD
--> Dev = Developers
--> QA = Testers
--> UAT = Client will use Apps and suggests

PROD / Live
--> PROD = Accessed by Users

Continuous Delivery = Deploying application to Production manually
Continuous Deployment = Deploying applications to Production automatically

==========================================

If I want to do CI / CD --> we use Pipelines

PIPELINE

Maven will do first few , compile , test and artifact but NOT DEPLOY
Maven will do manual, but Jenkins will automate these steps

=========================================

JENKINS

Its a free and open source tool (source code is available to use)
Jenkins written in java
its a platform independent (works on windows, Linux)
It consists of Plugins
We have community support
It can automate entire SDLC
It is owned by Sun micro system
Previous we called Hudson and it was a paid version
Later Oracle bought Hudson and made it free
Later Hudson was renamed as Jenkins
Inventor : Kohsuke Kawaguchi
Port number : 8080
Java: Java 11 / 17
Default path : /var/bin/jenkins

===========================
Alternatives : GO CI, Circle CI, Tarvis, Semaphore, Buddy Build Master, Gitlab, Harness, argoCD

CLOUD : AWS CodePipeline, Azure Pipeline

==================================


SETUP : Launch EC2 instance Amazon Linux 2

In SG, allow protocols, 8080, 80 http

To setup Jenkins, we need to take code from git , build using maven , that's the reason we install below all

Step 1: installing git, java 17 and maven
-----------------------------------------

yum install git java-17-amazon-corretto maven -y

Step 2: Getting the REPO (Jenkins.io --> download --> RedHat) - show in browser Jenkins.io --> LTS --> Redhat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

#STEP-3: DOWNLOAD and install JENKINS
----------------------------------------

yum install jenkins -y

#STEP-4: RESTARTING JENKINS (when we download service it will on stopped state)
----------------------------------

systemctl start jenkins.service

systemctl status jenkins.service

NOTE: chkconfig jenkins on
above command will make jenkins service automatically restart itself when sevrver is stopped and started

CONNECTION:
public-ip-server:8080 (browser)
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

give this password in browser and install plugins
give sample usernames and passwords --> start Jenkins

For logs:

journalctl -u jenkins
