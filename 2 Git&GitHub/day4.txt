=======================
GIT FORK - same as clone (remote to local) but fork (download code from one GitHub account to another GitHub account)
=====================

= If i want to enhance the code of another guy who has his own repo and code, instead me doing changes in his account directly i will fork it in my GitHub repo and do changes



In GitHub browser - search for another GitHub account(https://github.com/ReyazShaik/test) and fork to my account(trainerreyaz account)

GIT FORK and GIT CLONE -- Both repos should be public, for private use token

you cannot unfork, you  need to delete the repo



PR - PULL REQUEST
---------------

Be in trainerreyaz account and add or modify python1 file and commit

--> contribute --> pull request --> Finish
--> Go to actual reyazshaik GitHub account --> on top --> pull requests --> Click on Request and Merge

-- Again go to trainerreyaz account modify the file --> save --> contribute --> Create pull request

-- Come to reyazshaik account --> pull requests --> see what exactly code change is --> click on commits --> REview changes --> Add comment --> i dont like --> close the request


Sqaush and merge : combining the commits history
Use squash and merge for branches with many small or work-in-progress commits to keep the history clean.

Squash and Merge is a method used during the pull request (PR) or branch merging process to combine all the commits from a feature branch into a single commit on the target branch. This is particularly useful for maintaining a clean and concise commit history.

Rebase and Merge :  Retains individual commits


======================
PR - Pull Request
=======================

Everything what we did on git, now its do on GitHub

merge, rebase etc we did on git(local),

TO merge in github use PR

MERGE ON GITHUB - PR should be done on GitHub - from one branch to another branch

create a repo in GitHub and add a file in master branch...

create another branch test and add a file

Now create a PR

In GitHub on top --> Pull request --> New Pull Request --> select branches from where to where (test to master) --> see differences  --> Create Pull request --> pull request --> Merge pull request and confirm

Now code merges from branch to master


====================
Rename the Branch Name - GIT
=====================

touch python{1..5}

git add .

git commit -m "python" .

git branch dev1branch

git branch -m dev1branch testbranch

git checkout testbranch

touch java{1..5}

git add .

git commit -m "java" .


create a repo and push the files and branch

git remote add origin https://github.com/ReyazShaik/branching.git

git push origin master
git push origin testbranch

create a pull request and merge in GitHub

===============
GIT REVERT in GITHUB
=============
select View all branches in branch section --> which branch you want to revert --> select that branch --> Click PR and revert
-> it will create a revertbranch and revert



=======
git clean : delete untrack files

create a file and dont track
git clean -n filename  -- first git will ask
git clean -f filename  -- delete without asking



=========================
CHERRY PICK - Merging the specific files based on commits
========================
mkdir Reyaz
cd Reyaz
git init

touch file1
git add file1
git commit -m "file1" file1

git branch

git branch -m master branch1  [Rename master branch to branch1 for clarity]

git checkout -b branch2  [create branch2]

git checkout branch1  [be in branch1]

touch java{1..5}
git add java*
git commit -m "javafiles" java*

touch python{1..5}
git add python*
git commit -m "pythonfiles" python*

touch php{1..5}
git add php*
git commit -m "phpfiles" php*

to see how many commits
--------
git log --oneline
ls

git checkout branch2 [switch to branch2, in this branch we have only one file]

i want to merge branch2 with branch1 we use git merge,  but i dont want all files, i need only few [cherry pick]

git cherry-pick commit-id

git cherry-pick 16dufg(pythonfiles)
git cherry-pick 13gh56g(phpfiles)
ls

Now, this merge only pythonfiles and phpfiles

if you want to revert -- git revert commit-id

GIT TAG - For reference
====== =
git log --oneline

git tag tagname commitid

example:  git tag dev/prod 0620179

git log --oneline

=========================
GIT IGNORE - if you don't want to track the file, add filename in .gitignore
========================

In Same directory

touch file1.txt
touch file2.txt
git status
-- If I don't want to track
vi .gitignore
file1.txt

-- git status --- cant see file1

================
Delete Branch in GIT
==================
- git branch -D branchname
To get Branch restore - git checkout branchname
git branch

Restore deleted branch in GIT
===========================

git reflog

git checkout -b dev 3e98e1c(commitid)

Be in deleted branch and ls

=====================
Host website on GitHub
=====================

Create a repo and create index.html --> put some html code

setting --> pages --> branch master --> /root --> save --> you get the link



=================
MAKE REPO Public to Private in GitHub --> Repo settings --> danger zone --> change visibility
=================


===================
Delete branch in GitHub
================
view branches --> delete icon -- undo there itself -- rename the branch also there


===========================================
HOW to add multiple developers to GitHub
============================================
In GitHub --> Repo --> Settings --> Collaborators --> Add people

Like Kanban board --

Create a Project --> Select Table --> Create Task --> press tab --> and fields and assign people(tasks, assignees, start date, enddate)

Go to Project Settings --> Manage access --> give permissions
